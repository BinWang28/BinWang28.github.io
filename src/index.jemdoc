(*About Me*) I am currently a research scientist at [https://miromind.ai/ MiroMind], Singapore, where I focus on artificial general intelligence (AGI) and its practical applications. My previous roles include AI scientist at the Institute for Infocomm Research ([https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r I2R, A*STAR]) and research fellow at [https://www.nus.edu.sg NUS]. I earned my Ph.D. from the [https://www.usc.edu/ University of Southern California], Los Angeles, under the supervision of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.-C._Jay_Kuo C.C. Jay Kuo]. I have a strong track record of academic contributions, with over 40 papers published in top-tier conferences and journals including ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ACM KDD, TNNLS, and TASLP. My research has been recognized with multiple best paper awards. I have served as Publication Chair for EMNLP 2023 and as an editorial board member for APSIPA Transactions.
