== About me
I am currently a Research Fellow at National University of Singapore ([https://www.nus.edu.sg/ NUS]) - Human Language Technology ([https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/hlt/ HLT]) Lab working with Prof. [https://colips.org/~eleliha/ Haizhou Li]. 
\n
Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree from University of Southern California ([https://www.usc.edu/ USC]) supervised by Prof. [https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh C.-C. Jay Kuo] in May, 2021.
\n
My bachelor's degree is obtained from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([https://en.uestc.edu.cn/ UESTC]) in 2017.
