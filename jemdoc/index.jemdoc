== About me
I am a research scientist at Aural \& Language Intelligence Department, I2R, A\*STAR. 
\n
Before joing A*STAR, I was a research fellow at National University of Singapore ([https://www.nus.edu.sg/ NUS]) working with Prof. [https://colips.org/~eleliha/ Haizhou Li] from 2021-2023. 
\n
I received my Ph.D. degree from University of Southern California ([https://www.usc.edu/ USC]) supervised by Prof. [https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh C.-C. Jay Kuo] in 2021.
\n
My bachelor's degree is obtained from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([https://en.uestc.edu.cn/ UESTC]) in 2017.
